    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To create a web application that will allow users to a potluck event on their own profile account as well as add details needed for the potluck party, like adding food type, adding venue, time, date, and inviting new users.  New users can login and register after authorization is given and be able to check the itinerary of the event, add their own food items.
    </p>
    <h2>Organize Your PutLock</h2>  <!--focus on the things that may get done with putlock-->
    <p> Using our app you can now organize your Potluck for upcoming events, invite friends, adjust date and times for the event and even add or delete the food items for that special occasion.</p> 
        <p>Are you a guest? As a guest you are now able to browse itineraries and choose the food items you are responsible for.</p>
